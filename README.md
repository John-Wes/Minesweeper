## About

Welcome to my Java Swing implementation of the game 'Minesweeper'.

## Implementation

My implementation includes the following classes:

- `Tile.java`: Class that represents a single tile. Stores the tile's value and methods to interact with and draw the tile.
- `Board.java`: Class that represents the game board. Stores a 2D array of tiles, and methods to make moves, to check if the game is over, and to draw the board.
- `GameController.java`: Class that oversees how different elements interact.
- `GameView.java`: Class that includes the UX elements of the game. Also used to run the game.
